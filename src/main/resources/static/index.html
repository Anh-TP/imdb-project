<p>Your mission:

  Build a Spring-based application that can import a dataset from IMDB, store it in a database, and present a web-interface allowing it to be viewed and searched.

  Try to follow good development practices such as using version control well, as we/you may want to show this to third parties in future. Please don't commit the IMDB data. </p>
